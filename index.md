## Research
My PhD research topic is Intelligent Adaptive Underwater Sensor Networks. <br> 
Naval mines are inexpensive and easy to deploy but it is time consuming and costly to clear a mine field. Currently, the possibility of using multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) over conventional methods is being studied. Advantages include extended coverage area, potential cost and time efficiency, and more robust performance. A common issue that slows advancement in the underwater field is the limited available communication between platforms. The solution this PhD project proposes is scheduling meeting points for the vehicles so they can exchange status and mission information. So far, an adaptive method has been developed that adopts a greedy algorithm to enable task reallocation between the vehicles. The current work is focusing on an optimal planning method using an MDP.
