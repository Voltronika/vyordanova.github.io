Hi, I am Veronika. I am a visiting scientist in the Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation (CMRE) in La Spezia, Italy. I work on mission planning for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles. I am interested in applications and research relevent to marine autonomy, such as robotics, reinforcement learning, planning.
